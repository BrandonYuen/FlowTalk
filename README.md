# FlowTalk

A chat application made for my PR01-5 school project.
Created with the **[Sails](http://sailsjs.org)** MVC framework for NodeJS.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to learn the MVC principle using a framework of my own choice, and creating an actual working application with that chosen framework.

## Material Design & SASS
The front-end of FlowTalk was made using **[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)**; a front-end framework based on Material Design. I also used **SASS** to customize the design to my own liking and it is compiled to CSS automatically by adding a SASS compiler task to Grunt.

## WebSockets
The FlowTalk chat application uses websockets to send real-time messages between server and clients. Sails implements real-time communication between server and client on the server using the **[socket.io](http://socket.io/)** library, and on the client using the **[sails.io.js](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/web-sockets/socket-client/io-socket-on)** library.
